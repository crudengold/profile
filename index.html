      <h3>What were you doing before?</h3>
      <p>I worked in marketing roles for over ten years, within a variety of industries, including architecture practices, publishing houses and a luxury holiday company.</p>

      <p>Most recently I worked at a global electronics company. After two <em>very</em> dull years there, I felt it was time to move away from words and into code.</p>

      <h3>Why coding?</h3>
      <p>I have done a little bit of coding here and there for years, and decided now was the time to make it official!</p>
      <p>I made little, basic websites with my friends in school using html, then as I got into the world of work I enjoyed programming spreadsheets.</p>
      <p>Then, this year, I tried doing a Udemy course in Python and really loved it. A friend of mine recommended Le Wagon (he did the bootcamp in 2020), and the rest is history!</p>

      <h3>What are your hobbies?</h3>
      <p>I enjoy video games, board games, reading, fantasy football and quizzes.</p>

      <h3>You were on Pointless??</h3>
      <p>Yeah, I've probably bored you about it already, but here's a little clip of <a href="https://twitter.com/ldnkatyarcher/status/1396027223707107331" target="_blank">Richard Osman saying we had the 'greatest head-to-head performance in Pointless history'</a>. I will never ever shut up about it.</p>
